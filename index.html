        <h1>Final Project: Trends in Migrant Encounters and Border Seizures</h1>
        <h2>Bernadette Fannin and Dahlia Mihalic</h2>
        <center>
            <p>This project explores recent trends in migrant encounters and drug seizures across the U.S. border. Using
                interactive charts, we break down regional patterns, seasonal shifts, and enforcement outcomes across
                different states and sectors. Each section highlights a different part of the story- monthly encounter
                patterns, seizure activity, migrant origins, and the types of drugs being seized by state.</p>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>This graph shows the number of monthly encounters by AOR (Area of Responsibility) over time. The
                        x-axis represents the date, while the y-axis shows how many encounters occurred that month. Each
                        colored line stands for a different AOR, making it easy to spot trends across regions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Filter by State</h4>
                    <p>There is a dropdown menu that lets you filter the chart by state. This makes it easier to focus
                        on specific areas and see how they compare to others.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Tooltip Interactions</h4>
                    <p>When you hover over the lines, a tooltip pops up showing details like the AOR name, date, and
                        number of encounters for that point in time. It is a quick way to explore the data without
                        losing the bigger picture.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Average Line</h4>
                    <p>The chart also includes a dashed monthly average line. It acts as a reference point, so you can
                        easily see which AORs are trending above or below the overall average.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Legend & Design</h4>
                    <p>The scrollable legend shows all the AORs with matching colors. It's designed to be clean and
                        uncluttered so you can focus on the data. Overall, the chart is simple to use, responsive, and
                        informative.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Insight</h4>
                    <p>The data shows that San Diego and Laredo are consistently among the highest in monthly
                        encounters, especially during the spring and fall months. Tucson and Del Rio also show
                        noticeable spikes mid-year. These trends help highlight how certain regions experience more
                        activity depending on the season, and point to how migration patterns shift throughout the year.

                <p>This map shows where migrants are coming from and where they're being encountered at the U.S. border.
                    The arcs connect each country of citizenship to the U.S. sector where those encounters were

                <h4>Insight</h4>
                <p>Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela are some of the top origin countries, and most of their encounters
                    are happening in Texas and Arizona. We also see rising numbers from places like Haiti and China,
                    showing how the migration picture is expanding.</p>

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>This graph is a grouped bar chart that compares the number of encounters and seizures by AOR
                        (Area of Responsibility). The x-axis shows each AOR, while the y-axes show two different
                        measures: the number of encounters and seizures on the left, and the total weight of seizures on
                        the right.</p>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Chart Breakdown</h4>
                    <p>Each AOR has three bars: one for the number of encounters (the tall one), one for the number of
                        seizures, and one for the weight of seizures. The bars are color-coded so you can easily tell
                        the difference between the categories.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Tooltip Details</h4>
                    <p>Hovering over any bar brings up a tooltip with extra info like the AOR name, number of
                        encounters, seizures, and the total weight of seizures. This makes it easy to get the full
                        picture without leaving the chart.</p>

                    <h4>Extra Stats</h4>
                    <p>The tooltip also shows stats like seizures per encounter and average weight per seizure. These
                        are great for comparing how often seizures happen and how much is being carried when they do.
                    </p>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <h4>Insight</h4>
                    <p>This chart shows that even though San Diego has a high number of encounters, Laredo stands out
                        when it comes to average weight per seizure. It is a reminder that more activity doesn't always
                        mean higher volume; smaller sectors can still lead the way in certain metrics.</p>

                        total quantity of drugs seized in that state between 2022 and 2024. The bigger the box, the more
                        that state contributed to total seizures.</p>

                        also in specific drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine. It's a helpful way to compare both
                        volume and substance type across regions.</p>
